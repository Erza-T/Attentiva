## Inspiration
Our inspiration came from looking at studies investigating attention span. Most studies noted that attention spans have been on the decline, so we wanted to create an app to help individuals stay focused for longer.

## What it does
Our app has ‘focus sessions’ where we use the Muse 2 to record alpha, beta, theta, and gamma waves. Interpreting the waves, the app gives results to how attentive you were during the session.

## How we built it
1. We created an app prototype using Figma.
2. Then, we created a wireframe based on the prototype.
3. Given the wireframe, we split the project into three parts: Muse data processing, app backend and app frontend.
4. Once all the parts were completed, we put them all together to create the final project.

## Challenges we ran into
There were a lot of challenges that we ran into. All members of our group have never been to a hackathon before, and did not have much applied computing science knowledge.
1. All of our group members were in the computing science field, so additional time had to be spent researching basic neurological concepts.
2. Despite having selected a topic of interest prior to the hackathon, we decided to pivot from our original idea on the second day after being told that our idea was not practical enough.
3.  Since we pivoted to creating an android app, all of our previous code became obsolete.
4. After the pivot, the majority of coding had to be done in Java and XML. Half members were familiar with these languages prior to the hackathon, causing the other three members to learn these on their own, while trying their best to help.
5. None of our group members knew how to connect to a Muse device. It took us until the third day to figure it out.
6. None of our group members knew how to connect different files with one another when they are written in different languages.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Creating a working android app.
2. Creating a working connection between the Muse and our app.
3. Creating multiple regression models based on EEG data.
4. Learning many new coding languages.
5. Learning new ways of connecting different code aspects.
6. Applying abstract data types in app creation.

## What we learned
1. Having an interdisciplinary team is an asset.
2. Doing extensive research on the topic of interest and related concepts is valuable.
3. Having clear communication between team members prevents code refactors.
4. Clarifying constraints, rubrics and timelines with NatHacks organizers and following up on answers is valuable to all hackers.
5. Doing extensive preparation in software deployment beyond NatHacks presentations is crucial.

## What's next for Attentiva
We seek to improve Attentiva by creating additional functionalities to turn it into a lifestyle and marketing must-have.
Lifestyle:
1. Add push notifications for focus alerts and reminders.
2. Add a timer functionality to set time limits on focus sessions.
3. Integrate focus sessions with device do not disturb modes.
4. Create synced group focus sessions.
5. Create user session saving functionality to track progress between sessions.
Marketing:
1. Create commercial accounts with history tracking and advanced/live data viewing for customer biofeedback. 
2. Implement eye tracking to help advertisers make well-informed decisions on product design.
